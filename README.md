# Student_performance_analysis_using_Python
 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset related to student performance, focusing on various factors that may impact their scores. The dataset, Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv, is loaded and explored using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.

## The notebook includes tasks such as:

Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.

Analyzing gender distribution and its impact on scores.

Investigating parental education levels and their influence on student performance.

Evaluating the impact of parental marital status on student scores.

Exploring the distribution of different ethnic groups.

## üîé Project Insights
Gender Distribution Analysis:
The analysis shows that the number of female students in the dataset is higher than the number of male students. However, the gender of the student does not seem to have a significant impact on overall performance.

## Parental Education Impact:
A notable insight from the visual analysis is that students whose parents have higher education tend to score better. This suggests a positive correlation between parental education levels and student academic performance.

## Parental Marital Status Effect:
Surprisingly, the data reveals that parental marital status does not have a significant or noticeable impact on student scores, suggesting that factors such as marital status may not heavily influence academic outcomes.

## Ethnic Group Distribution:
The distribution of different ethnic groups is analyzed to identify any trends, but the impact of ethnicity on student performance is not emphasized as a strong influencing factor.

## üìù Conclusion
The project successfully explores various demographic and socio-economic factors and their impact on student performance. The key takeaway is that parental education plays a crucial role in influencing student scores, while gender and parental marital status have minimal to no impact. The insights derived from this analysis can guide educators and policymakers to focus on enhancing parental engagement in education as a strategy to improve student outcomes.
